## Project Description

Once completed, the program will simulate the Pig game, allowing players to take turns rolling a virtual die, tracking scores, and deciding when to hold or risk rolling again, with the ultimate goal of reaching 100 points to win.

## Technology Stack

We are using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to develop the Pig game because these technologies are ideal for creating an interactive, user-friendly web-based application. 

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game interface, allowing us to define elements like buttons for rolling the dice, holding scores, and displaying player scores and the game status.
- **CSS**: Styles the game, ensuring it is visually appealing and engaging for users by customizing the layout, colors, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, handling player interactions such as rolling the die, updating scores dynamically, managing game rules (e.g., ending a turn when a 1 is rolled), and determining the winner.
