# Rolling Team

## Project Description

Once completed, the program will simulate the Pig game, providing a virtual environment where players can take turns rolling a six-sided die to accumulate points. The program will track each playerâ€™s current turn score and total score, and allow players to make decisions about whether to roll again to risk earning more points or to hold and secure their turn score. If a player rolls a 1, the program will reset their turn score to zero and end their turn, implementing the risk-and-reward dynamic of the game. The program will determine the winner by identifying the first player to reach or exceed 100 points, while handling game rules, scorekeeping, and player interactions seamlessly.

## Technology Stack

We are using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to develop the Pig game because these technologies are ideal for creating an interactive, user-friendly web-based application. 

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the game interface, allowing us to define elements like buttons for rolling the dice, holding scores, and displaying player scores and the game status.
- **CSS**: Styles the game, ensuring it is visually appealing and engaging for users by customizing the layout, colors, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Implements the game logic, handling player interactions such as rolling the die, updating scores dynamically, managing game rules (e.g., ending a turn when a 1 is rolled), and determining the winner.
